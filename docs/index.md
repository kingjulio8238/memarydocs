### Manage Your Agent Memories 
!!! info "Why memary"
    Agents promote human-type reasoning and are a great advancement towards building AGI and understanding ourselves as humans. Memory is a key component of how humans approach tasks and should be weighted the same when building agentic systems. **memary emulates human memory to advance such agentic systems.** 
<!--
Agents use LLMs that are currently constrained to finite context windows. memary overcomes this limitation by allowing your agents to store a large corpus of information in knowledge graphs, infer user knowledge through our memory modules, and only retrieve relevant information for meaningful responses.
