### Manage Your AI Agents Memory 

!!! info "Why memary"
    Agents promote human-type reasoning and is an advancement towards building AGI and understanding ourselves. Memory is a key component of how humans approach tasks and should be weighted the same when building agentic systems. memary emulates human memory to advance these agentic systems. 
    <!--
    Agents use LLMs that are currently constrained to finite context windows. memary overcomes this limitation by allowing your agents to store a large corpus of information in knowledge graphs, infer user knowledge through our memory modules, and only retrieve relevant information for meaningful responses.

### Memory Dashboard 
Visualize and analyze your agents memory in your Memory Dashboard (coming soon).
!!! info "Features"
    - Search your agents' memory. 
    - Understand how your agents learn and improve reasoning over time. 
    - Rewind executions to understand changes to agents' memories.
    - Understand audience preferences. 
    - Parse proprietry data from multiple file types into agent databases. 
    - Configure parent parsers.   
    - View and search agent databases. 
    - Configure type of models used across the system. 
    - Be notified when agent memory has been updated.
