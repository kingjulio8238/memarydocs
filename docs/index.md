### Manage Your AI Agents Memories 

!!! info "Why memary"
    Agents promote human-type reasoning and is an advancement towards building AGI and understanding ourselves. Memory is a key component of how humans approach tasks and should be weighted the same when building agentic systems. memary emulates human memory to advance these agentic systems. 
    <!--
    Agents use LLMs that are currently constrained to finite context windows. memary overcomes this limitation by allowing your agents to store a large corpus of information in knowledge graphs, infer user knowledge through our memory modules, and only retrieve relevant information for meaningful responses.
